My academic journey is driven by a deep passion for technology and security, with the ultimate goal of becoming an expert in the field of cybersecurity. I enjoy working on web development projects, exploring new technologies, and understanding how web applications function. This interest complements my role as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at the [Astronautic Institute](https://astronauticinstitute.com), where I oversee technical projects and manage development efforts.\r\n\r\nIn my spare time, I like to invest my energy in learning new things, particularly in the field of cybersecurity, to stay ahead of emerging trends and threats. I also enjoy developing my chess skills, as the game enhances my strategic thinking and problem-solving abilities\u2014qualities that are essential in both cybersecurity and life.\r\n\r\n# Some History\r\n\r\n- At age 5, I attended a Scholastic book fair and picked up my very first book about planets. This was the beginning of a lifelong interest in [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy). Every year, I would return to these book fairs and expand my collection, diving deeper into the mysteries of space and the universe.\r\n\r\n- At 14, I took the [National Space Olympiad](https://www.edukidsworld.com/space-olympiad.html) on a whim, without studying. Despite that, I managed to score fairly well, which further encouraged my growing fascination with astronomy and space science.\r\n\r\n- When I was 16, the [COVID-19 lockdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns) pushed everything online, and this shift ignited a new passion for technology. As I spent more time exploring the digital world, my curiosity naturally gravitated toward [cybersecurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersecurity)\u2014a field that intrigued me for its blend of problem-solving and technical challenges.\r\n\r\n- Later that year, I almost got into trouble when I attempted to modify my score in a mock exam at my coaching institute. It was a risky move that taught me valuable lessons about responsibility and the ethical use of technology.\r\n\r\n- At 17, I connected with a senior who had co-founded an ed-tech startup called [Astronautic Institute](https://astronauticinstitute.com). This marked a turning point, as I volunteered to develop their website, an opportunity that sparked my interest in [web development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development) and gave me my first taste of leadership in a technical role.\r\n\r\n- By 18, I had enrolled in [VIT Bhopal University](https://vitbhopal.ac.in) to pursue a [BTech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Technology) in Cybersecurity and [Digital Forensics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_forensics). Around the same time, I officially became the [CTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer) of [Astronautic Institute](https://astronauticinstitute.com), a role that allowed me to hone my technical and leadership skills while driving the company's technology strategy.\r\n\r\n- At 19, I achieved a significant milestone by earning my [CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)](https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/) certification, which further validated my expertise in cybersecurity and set the stage for my continued growth in the field.\r\n# I Like\r\n\r\n- Running\r\n- Chess\r\n-cyceling\r\n- Coding\r\n- Exploring random facts\r\n- Space\r\n- Summer\r\n- Books\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fun Facts\r\n- I can solve rubics cube in under 2 minitues.\r\n- I can play chess well without ever learning it.\r\n- I one day randomly aproached my friend to make a website for his startup an I am now its CTO.\r\n- I love coffee.\r\n\r\n# I Dream Of\r\n\r\n- Being able to serve for my country somehow.\r\n- Inspiring and feeling inspired.\r\n- Enabling a brighter future for everyone, regardless of political or socioeconomic status.\r\n- Treating every individual with genuine kindness and respect.\r\n- Staying curious.\r\n- Continually improving.\r\n- You not checking the commit history for earlier drafts of this file.\r\n",l=c.split(/\s+/).map((e=>e.replace(/\W/g,""))).filter((e=>e.length)).length,h=e=>{let{...t}=e;return(0,s.jsx)(n.rU,{...t})},d=()=>(0,s.jsx)(o.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Adi Kulkarni",children:(0,s.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,s.jsx)("header",{children:(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,s.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,s.jsx)(n.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,s.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",l," words)"]})]})}),(0,s.jsx)(a(),{source:c,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}]);
